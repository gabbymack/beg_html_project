			<h2>"We cook for enjoyment, and we eat deliciously replenish. Our aspiration is to redefine expectations for vegan restaurant food. Our menu is small so that we can remake it daily. The food you see and smell before you was prepared by the chefs that you see in the kitchen, on the spot daily."<br><i>– chef Molly Gabbard</i></h2>
